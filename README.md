Cheep ORM
----------


### What is it?

Cheep ORM is a simple reflection-based object relational mapping. It does not attempt to solve the [Object-Relational mapping impedance mismatch](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/06/object-relational-mapping-is-the-vietnam-of-computer-science.html), but opts for the "Acceptance of ORM limitations" solution.

It is best described as an Object-Row mapping - using reflection and JPA to perform CRUD operations on database rows, with some sugar for listing and iterating result sets.
